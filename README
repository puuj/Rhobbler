# Rhobbler

The dead simple tool to submit your Rhapsody listening information to Last.FM.

## About this project

This is the source code to "Version 2" of the Rhobbler site. What you see here is not what is on rhobbler.com. Not yet.

I've been running Rhobbler for about 5 years now, and the code there has barely changed since I first wrote it.
I nudged it along to Rails 2.2 and it has kind of stagnated since then. I don't even want to look at the code for fear of how stale it is.
However, there are magically somewhere around 700 active users of Rhobbler, myself included. It has worked pretty well, all things considered.

Rhapsody recently changed their entire front-facing infrastructure, so the RSS feeds I was depending on are no longer available to new users.
Adding a new way of importing Rhapsody data to the old project is out of the question.
Thus, "Rhobbler2" was born.

This project is written to be a cutting-edge Rails project, and will use a lot of experimental tools.
In addition to being a useful tool for many people, this project will be my playground for the new stuff in the Rails ecosystem.
However, this project will be my first project that I've done soup-to-nuts TDD, so hopefully the "experimental" and the "tested" sides will balance out.
